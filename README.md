# IP_Hash_Map

Language: C++

Focus: Data Structures

Technologies: Linked Lists, Hashmaps, File streams

I obtained a text file containing the IP adresses of attackers on Wake Forest Computer Science Department's server and 
implemented a hashmap atop a SLList.  After the hashmap is created it then reports the five most threatening IP Adresses
so our system administrator can block their IPs.
